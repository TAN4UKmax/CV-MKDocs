About me
--------

Hello. I am Maksym Tanchuk and I do Electrical/Embedded Enineering.

It is me at Moscow.

As an embedded systems engineer I do calculations and modeling in MATLAB/Simulink. Based on modeling results I develop digital electronic devices using STM32 and ATMEL microcontrollers. You can look what exactly I do through [**my portfolio**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nb57aAj6b8ldJxEBDAUccIsqwLOzq9PD/view?usp=sharing "Portfolio").
